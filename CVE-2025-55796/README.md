# CVE-2025-55796: Predictable MD5 Token Bypass in OpenML Signup, Confirmation, and Password Reset
- **Affected Versions:** v2.0.20241110
- **Fixed Version:** v2.0.20251111

## Summary
OpenML versions <= v2.0.20241110 use predictable MD5-based tokens for user signup confirmation,
password resets, email confirmation resends, and email change confirmation. Tokens are generated by hashing the current
timestamp formatted as "%d %H:%M:%S" without incorporating user-specific data or cryptographic randomness.

This leads to a critical vulnerability where tokens can be predicted by:
- Triggering token generation endpoints.
- Enumerating tokens across all timezones for the token creation time window.
- Validating these tokens against token verification endpoints.
