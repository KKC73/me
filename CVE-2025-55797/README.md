# CVE-2025-55797: Unintended Information Disclosure
- **Affected Versions:** v0.5.4
- **Fixed Version:** v0.5.5

## Summary
An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the /api/schemas/history/[schemaId] endpoint. The endpoint returns all historical versions of a schema — including the complete schema data — without requiring any authentication or authorization.

An attacker who knows or can guess a valid schemaId could retrieve the entire schema history and associated schema definitions without having legitimate access.
