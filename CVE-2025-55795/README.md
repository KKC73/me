# CVE-2025-55795: Account Lockout of Other Users via Insufficient Email Ownership Verification
- **Affected Versions:** v2.0.20241110
- **Fixed Version:** v2.0.20251111

## Summary
This vulnerability arises due to insufficient email ownership verification during the profile email update process.
An attacker controlling a user account with a lower user ID can update their email address to that of another user
with a higher user ID. The victim’s active access token becomes invalid immediately. The victim's original email becomes assigned to the attacker’s account. Consequently, the victim loses access to their original account.
